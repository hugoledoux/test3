CityGML modules and characteristics supported
---------------------------------------------

At this moment, CityJSON implements most of the data model, and *all* the CityGML modules have been mapped to CityJSON objects.
However, for the sake of simplicity and efficiency, some modules and features have been omitted and/or simplified.
If a module is supported, it does not mean that there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the classes and features in CityGML and CityJSON, but rather that it is possible to represent the same information, but in a different manner.
CityJSON is thus conformant to a subset of CityGML (although technically only CityGML files can be conformant to the specifications of CityGML, see Section 2 of `the official documentation <https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842>`_).

The types of objects stored in CityGML are grouped into different modules, and CityJSON supports these (more details below):

#. **CityGML Core**: all geometries can be represented, Implicit Geometries are supported. However, the ``ExternalReferences`` are not supported. Address: everything is supported.
#. **Building**: everything is supported except LoD4 features (interior of buildings) and the concept of Terrain-Intersection-Curve (TIC)
#. **Bridge**: everything is supported except LoD4 features (interior rooms of bridges)
#. **Tunnel**: everything is supported except LoD4 features (interior parts of Tunnel Installations)
#. **CityFurniture**: benches, traffic lights, signs, etc. are all supported
#. **LandUse**: everything supported
#. **Relief/DTM**: only the ``TINRelief/TriangulatedSurface`` is currently supported. ``Tin`` (where only elevation points and break lines are stored) is not supported since it would require viewer/applications to have a Constrained Delaunay Triangulator, which is problematic (especially for web-based tools). Also, it is not possible to store areas over a terrain that would support different resolutions (as in Figure 25 of the `CityGML standard document <https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842>`_). ``RasterRelief`` is also not supported.
#. **Transportation**: most modules supported, except the class "Path" is not used (an attribute to the class "Road" is used instead). We plan to develop a network type in future versions to support modelling a network properly, a simple set of line strings is not sufficient.
#. **CityObjectGroup**: groups of City Objects are supported, but not groups of parts of objects (eg it is not possible to group some walls of a building together)
#. **Vegetation**: everything is supported
#. **WaterBody**: everything is supported
#. **Generics**: everything is supported
#. **Groups**: everything is supported, except that groups can only be for grouping City Objects (and not surfaces or parts of City Objects as it can be in CityGML)


Furthermore, for the **Appearance** module: The CityGML class ``GeoreferencedTexture`` is not supported. The CityGML class ``TexCoordGen`` is not supported, ie one must specify the UV coordinates in the texture files. Also, the texture files have to be local and put in folder named ``"appearances"`` located in the same folder as the CityJSON file (thus requests to web services as is the case with CityGML are not supported).

`ADEs (Application Domain Extensions) <https://www.citygml.org/ade/>`_ are also supported from CityJSON v0.8, see :doc:`extensions`.

.. note::
  CityJSON has built-in support for the metadata of a dataset, while, surprisingly, CityGML does not.


Other CityGML modules and characteristics not supported
-------------------------------------------------------

#. in CityGML most objects can have an ID (usually ``gml:id``), that is one Building can have an ID, but also each 3D primitive forming its geometry can have an ID. In CityJSON, only :ref:`specs_cityobjects` can have IDs, and each :ref:`specs_semantics`. 
#. no support for arbitrary coordinate reference systems (CRSs). Only an `EPSG code <https://epsg.io>`_ can be used. Furthermore, all geometries in a given CityJSON must be using the same CRS.
#. no support for the topological relationships that can be defined, eg  *relativeToTerrain* and *relativeToWater*
#. no *ClosureSurface*
